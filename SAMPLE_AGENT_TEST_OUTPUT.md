--- Test Section 2: Negative Feedback & Retry Logic ---

User Question (S2P1 Attempt 1): Make the character jump higher
No existing tool met threshold (0.3) (exclusions: None). Best was 'SetPlayerAttribute' (0.2871).
No suitable existing tool found for prompt: 'Make the character jump higher' (exclusions: None). Attempting to define a new tool.
LLM defined new tool - Name: 'IncreaseJumpHeight', Desc: 'This tool allows the user to adjust the jump height of a character in a game or simulation, enabling them to jump higher than before. The input for this tool would typically be the desired increase in jump height or a multiplier to apply to the character's current jump height.'
Successfully created and registered new dynamic tool: IncreaseJumpHeight
Agent Answer (S2P1 Att 1 - Tool: IncreaseJumpHeight): Based on tool IncreaseJumpHeight (Similarity: 1.0000): Observation: Placeholder for newly created dynamic tool 'IncreaseJumpHeight' called with input: 'IncreaseJumpHeight: +50%'.
Simulating DOWNVOTE for tool 'IncreaseJumpHeight' for prompt 'Make the character jump higher'
Downvote recorded for tool 'IncreaseJumpHeight' for prompt 'Make the character jump higher'. It will be excluded in immediate retry.

User Question (S2P1 Attempt 2 - after downvoting IncreaseJumpHeight): Make the character jump higher
No existing tool met threshold (0.3) (exclusions: ['IncreaseJumpHeight']). Best was 'SetPlayerAttribute' (0.2871).
No suitable existing tool found for prompt: 'Make the character jump higher' (exclusions: ['IncreaseJumpHeight']). Attempting to define a new tool.
LLM tried to define a tool 'IncreaseJumpHeight' which already exists. Skipping creation.
Failed to find or create a suitable tool for: 'Make the character jump higher' (exclusions: ['IncreaseJumpHeight']). Generating direct answer.
Agent Answer (S2P1 Att 2 - Tool: None): Direct Answer: To make a character jump higher in a game or animation, you can adjust the jump height parameter in the game's code or animation software. Increasing the jump height value will allow the character to jump higher when the jump action is triggered. Additionally, you can also consider adding power-ups or upgrades within the game that enhance the character's jumping abilities.

## Key Observations

1. **Tool Selection Based on Similarity:**
   - The agent selects tools based on similarity score when it exceeds the threshold (0.3-0.4)
   - For example, "Set the player's health to 75" matches with SetPlayerAttribute (0.3970)

2. **Dynamic Tool Creation:**
   - When no existing tool meets the similarity threshold, the agent creates a new one
   - Example: "What is the main ingredient in bread?" creates BreadIngredientFinder

3. **Learning from Feedback:**
   - After upvotes, similarity scores for identical prompts reach 1.0000
   - Similar prompts (like "move the player character to 0,100,0" after upvoting "Teleport player to coordinates 0,100,0") show higher similarity scores

4. **Downvote Retry Logic:**
   - When a tool is downvoted, it's excluded from immediate retry
   - The agent tries to create a new tool or fallback to a direct answer
   - Example: After downvoting ChangeSkybox for "Dim the lights in the scene", it creates DimLightsInScene

5. **Duplicate Tool Prevention:**
   - The agent checks if a tool name already exists before creating it
   - Example: "LLM tried to define a tool 'IncreaseJumpHeight' which already exists. Skipping creation."
